This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying the pages in the `pages` folder. Pages auto-update as you save the file ("hot reloading").

## Files Guide

### **Pages**

### _app.js

This "page" overrides the default App component that initializes pages. Recommended to use for page layouts that are used in all pages (eg. the navbar is always present in all pages, so its code is in _app.js)

This project also contains the HTML `<head>` tag in _app.js.

### index.js

This page is the default page that loads when visiting [animefest.ucsd.moe](https://animefest.ucsd.moe)
